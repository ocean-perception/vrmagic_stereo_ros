This is a small demonstration program for the vrmusbcam library and the 
object recognition functionality of the vm_lib machine vision library. 

You need the SDL-library including development package installed on your
system (libsdl1.2 and libsdl1.2-dev packages under Debian).


Quit the demo application with ESC.
